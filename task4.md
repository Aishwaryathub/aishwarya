**Meeting Held on: 27/02/2024**

**The C code should undergo the simulation of normal GCC X86 Compiler and riscv compiler** (**SPIKE Simulation**) 

**AS PER THE REQUIREMENT OUTPUT OF GCC (F1) SHOULD BE EQUAL = TO OUTPUT OF RISCV GCC (F2)**

Step - 1: To Run the code in the normal GCC Compiler To compile the code: gcc sum1ton.c -o sum1ton To Get the output use "./a.out" : Here the output finds to be -Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 125250

Step - 2: To Run the code in the RISC-V GCC Compiler

To compile the code: riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o sum1ton sum1ton.c To Get the output use "./a.out" : Here the output finds to be -Sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is 125250
